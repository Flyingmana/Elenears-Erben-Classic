Server - Client side separation
-------------------------------

server and client code should be separated.
So we hopefully avoid using restrictions on client side code,
because we cant control them anyway.

In result we have an http API on server side, which can not only be used by a
ajax application on this domain. It can be used for example by mobile apps
or desktop clients, too.

This causes, that the development of the client side code (js and html)
must be totally separated from the server side code.
