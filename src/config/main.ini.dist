# If you provide template paths here, they will be checked for all included
# templates befor the module template paths are checked, and before the default

# modules are used on project level is defined in the projects configuration.

[mail]

# Options for sending mails
#
# Arbit supports different transport types for sending mails. Beside the
# default sendmail transport you may send mails using SMTP with auth, even
# through encrypted connections.
#
# Select one of the following transports, or reference a custom class, which
# implements the mail transport mechanism. If you don't know what to set here,
# just leave the value "mta" there, which will work in most cases. The
# transport options are set below.
#
# - mta (default, the classic sendmail transport)
# - smtp
# (- myCustomTransport)
transport=mta

# Transport options.
#
# The required options depend on the used transport, like the SMTP transport
# requirs auth information and perhaps encryption information. There are common
# options like the default sender address. Check the documentation of the
# respective transport for details.
