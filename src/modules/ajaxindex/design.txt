======================================
Design description - Ajax Index Module
======================================


The *Ajax Index Module* offer a place, for ajax based one site applications.

The main idea is, that other modules only represent an http-API and the *Ajax
Index Modules* allows you to include css and js files, which represent the
real application.
To make the application aware about active modules, it also offers a list
of all activated modules and how they are named.

It is possible add external css and js files to the site.



needed decisions
----------------

 * should the *real application* be a module too?
 * what would be the best way to add the *real application* to the *Ajax Index Module*

possible additions
------------------

 * version info of modules
